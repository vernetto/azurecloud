## Case description and current state

Bell-Fin JSC Overview:

    Company Profile: Bell-Fin JSC is a midsize financial company based in the USA,
    with headquarters in Galloway, NJ, and another office in San Diego, CA.

IT Infrastructure & Transition:

    Pre-COVID-19: The entire IT infrastructure was on-premises with Windows being the dominant platform. 
    All devices were using Windows 10, maintaining the latest build minus one.
    During COVID-19: To accommodate remote work, the company adopted Office 365 and other SaaS solutions. 
    Employees accessed internal systems via VPN, which didn't meet the granularity and endpoint security assessment needs of the IT and Information Security teams.

Identity and Access Management:

    AD Forest Design: Bell-Fin JSC has been using a single Active Directory Forest design 15 years ago. 
    While the directory's infrastructure is up-to-date, its internal domain naming convention (bell-fin.local) doesn't follow best practices.
    SaaS Account Management: When integrating Microsoft SaaS services and other SaaS solutions, user accounts were manually provisioned as per requests in a single Azure AD tenant (bell-fin.onmicrosoft.com).

Challenges & Concerns:

    Identity Management: There's a need to centralize and consolidate account management using their internal Active Directory.
    Security: The company faced challenges related to MFA enforcement, monitoring of compromised accounts, and blocking unsafe passwords.
    Password Reset: There were incidents involving successful social engineering attacks targeting the Help Desk staff due to issues with the remote password reset process.
    Device Compliance: The company desires to conditionally grant access based on both user authentication and the compliance state of their device.
    Partner Collaboration: Bell-Fin JSC is expanding partnerships, like with Vasil Brokers. They aim to provide access to their business apps to partners without compromising security or overburdening their helpdesk.

In essence, Bell-Fin JSC, post COVID-19, is seeking to upgrade and integrate their identity management solutions, address security concerns, and enhance their collaboration capabilities with partners while ensuring the robustness of their IT infrastructure.

    Enhanced Security: Bell-Fin JSC aims to:
        Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across VPNs, line-of-business apps, and other informational systems.
        Address concerns related to compromised accounts and weak password usage.
        Establish secure methods for password resets, reducing human-related risks.
        Ensure device compliance and secure access for business-critical operations.

    Business Agility: Ensure the company's infrastructure allows for seamless work, regardless of potential cloud service outages or issues with internal systems. This will provide flexibility and ensure operations aren't interrupted by IT disruptions.

    Efficient Partner Collaboration: Implement secure and manageable collaboration methods with partners like Vasil Brokers, without compromising security or placing undue burdens on internal resources.

In summary, Bell-Fin JSC's primary objectives revolve around improving IT resilience, security, operational efficiency, and enhancing collaboration capabilities, all underpinned by a strong emphasis on modern identity and access management solutions.
